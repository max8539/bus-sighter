# bus-sighter
A website where the community can contribute information and track buses. More info coming soon, once I start coding more of the website.

# IMPORTANT
Project currently not open to contributions, your pull request will be rejected - will likely be open to contributions in the future, however I would like to create the foundations of the project first. 
This project will also be a learning journey for myself, getting to grips with different aspects of web development, which wouldn't happen if others just wrote everything from the get-go.
